            <p>Visakhapatnam (/vɪˌsɑːkəˈpʌtnəm/, formerly known as Vizagapatam[15]), also known as Vizag, Viśākha or Waltair,[1][16][17] is the largest and most populous metropolitan city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is between the Eastern Ghats and the coast of the Bay of Bengal.[18][19] It is the second largest city on the east coast of India after Chennai, and the fourth-largest in South India. It is one of the four smart cities of Andhra Pradesh selected under the Smart Cities Mission[20] and is the headquarters of Visakhapatnam district.[21] With an estimated output of $43.5 billion, it is the ninth-largest contributor to India's gross domestic product as of 2016</p>
            <p>Visakhapatnam's history dates back to the 6th century BCE. It was ruled by the Andhra Satavahanas, Vengi, the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties.[24][25] Visakhapatnam was an ancient Port city which had trade relations with the Middle East and Rome. Ships were anchored at open roads and were loaded with cargo transported from Visakhapatnam shore using small Masula boats. A reference to Vizagapatnam merchant is available in the inscriptions of Bheemeswara temple (1068 CE) of East Godavari District. During the 12th century CE, Vizagapatnam was a fortified merchandise town managed by a guild.[26] European powers eventually established trade operations in the city, and by the end of the 18th century it had come under French colonial rule.[27][28] Control passed to the East India Company in 1804 and it remained under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947.</p>
            <p>The city is home to some reputed Central and State educational institutions of the state, including Andhra University (AU), Andhra Medical College (AMC), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE), Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University (DSNLU), Indian Maritime University (IMU), and the National Institute of Oceanography among others. Visakhapatnam serves as the headquarters for the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command.[29] The city also serves as the zonal headquarters of South Coast Railway Zone (SCoR). The city is also home to the oldest shipyard and the only natural harbour on the east coast of India.[30] Visakhapatnam Port is the fifth-busiest cargo port in India. The city is a major tourist destination and is known for its beaches, ancient Buddhist sites, and the natural environment of the surrounding Eastern Ghats.[31] It is nicknamed as the "City of Destiny" and the "Jewel of the East Coast".[21] According to the Swachh Survekshan rankings of 2020, it is the ninth cleanest city in India among cities with a population of more than 1 million.[32] In 2020, it was a finalist in the Living and Inclusion category of the World Smart City Awards.[33] On 31 January 2023, it was announced that the city will become the capital of Andhra Pradesh.[34]</p>
            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The local belief behind the name of the city-states, there was a king of the 4th century, who on his pilgrimage halted at Lawson's Bay and built a temple dedicated to Vaisakha, which was submerged under the sea, but the name of the temple was got to the settlement. Other such names are, Kulotungapatnam, named by the Chola King Kulottunga I; Ishakapatnam, based on a Muslim Saint, Syed Ali Madani (Ishak Madani).[35][36] During the East India Company rule in India, the city was known with the name, Vizagapatnam.[37] The suburb Waltair is another such name which was derived from the name the British colonial government used.[21] "Vizagapatnam" could also be spelled Visakhapatnam in the West European alphabet. The name was popularly shortened to Vizag and this form was in use right from the earliest days of British colonial rule in the district in the late eighteenth century.[38] It is still referred to as Vizag by locals too, however since independence, people have reverted to calling it by its Indian name of Visakhapatnam</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Visakhapatnam's history stretches back to the 6th century BCE and the city finds mention in ancient texts such as the 4th century BCE writings of Pāṇini and Katyayana. Historically considered part of the Kalinga region,[27][28] it was ruled by the Vengi kingdom and the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties during medieval times.[24] Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the Chola dynasty king Kulothunga I. Control over the city fluctuated between the Chola dynasty of Tamil Nadu and the Gajapati Kingdom of Odisha[27][28] until its conquest by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century.[24] European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under French rule at the end of the 18th century</p>
            <p>The city was ruled by the Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Visakha Varma. Legend has it that Radha and Viśakha were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Visakka Sakhi is the second most important gopi of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert Gopi messenger. Residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Viśakha. This is now inundated under seawater near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named Viśakha. Later it was ruled by Qutb Shahis (1571–1674), Kingdom of Jeypore (1535–1571) and (1674–1711), Mughal Empire (1711–1724), Nizam (1724–1757) and France (1757–1765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually established trading operations in the city and Visakhapatnam came under French colonial rule at the end of the 18th century.</p>
            <p>The British East India Company captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 Battle of Vizagapatnam and it remained under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947 which was a part of the Northern Circars.</p>
